## Description

puppetlabs-pe_status_check provides a way to alert the end-user when Puppet Enterprise is not in an ideal state. It uses pre-set indicators and has a simplified output that directs the end-user to the next steps for resolution.

Users of the tool have a greater ability to provide their own self-service resolutions and shorter incident resolution times with Puppet Support due to higher quality information available to our team.

## Setup

### What pe_status_check affects

This module installs two structured facts named `pe_status_check` and `agent_status_check`. Each fact contains an array of key pairs that output an indicator ID and a Boolean value. The `pe_status_check` fact is confined to only Puppet Enterprise infrastructure agents, and the `agent_status_check` fact is confined to non-infrastructure agent nodes.

### Setup requirements

Install the module, plug-in sync will be used to deliver the required facts for this module, to each agent node in the environment the module is installed in.

### Beginning with pe_status_check

This module primarily provides indicators using facts, so installing the module and allowing plug-in sync to occur lets the module start functioning.
Collection of the `agent_status_check` fact is disabled by default so as not to affect all puppet agents indiscriminately

## Usage

The facts in this module can be directly consumed by monitoring tools such as Splunk, any element in the structured facts `pe_status_check` or `agent_status_check` reporting as `false` indicates a fault state in Puppet Enterprise. When any element reports as `false`, look up the incident ID in the reference section for next steps.

Alternatively, assigning the `class pe_status_check` to the infrastructure notifies on each Puppet run if any indicator is reporting as `false`, this can be viewed in the Puppet report for each node.

### Enabling agent_status_check

By default your normal agent population will not collect the `agent_status_check` fact, this can be enabled for all agents or a subset of agents, by classifying pe_status_check::agent_status_enable to your nodes.

### Disabling agent_status_check

Following the addition of the class `pe_status_check::agent_status_enable` to an agent node, disable the collection of agent_status_check fact, set the following parameter:

`pe_status_check::agent_status_enable::agent_status_enabled = false`

## Reporting Options

### Class declaration pe_status_check (optional)

To activate the notification functions of this module, classify your Puppet Infrastructure with the `pe_status_check` class using [your preferred classification method](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/grouping_and_classifying_nodes.html#enable_console_configuration_data). Below is an example using `site.pp`.

```puppet
node 'node.example.com' {
  include pe_status_check
}
```

For maximum coverage, report on all default indicators. However, if you need to make exceptions for your environment, classify the array parameter `indicator_exclusions` with a list of all the indicators you do not want to report on.

This workflow is not available for the `agent_status_check` fact.

```puppet
class { 'pe_status_check':
  indicator_exclusions             => ['S0001','S0003','S0003','S0004'],
}
```

### Ad-hoc Report (Plans)

The plans, `pe_status_check::infra_summary` and `pe_status_check::agent_summary` summarize the status of each of the checks on target nodes that have the `pe_status_check` or `agent_status_check` fact respectively, sample output can be seen below:

```json
{
    "nodes": {
        "details": {
            "pe-psql-70aefa-0.region-a.domain.com": {
                "failed_tests_count": 0,
                "passing_tests_count": 13,
                "failed_tests_details": []
            },
            "pe-server-70aefa-0.region-a.domain.com": {
                "failed_tests_count": 1,
                "passing_tests_count": 30,
                "failed_tests_details": [
                    "S0022 Determines if there is a valid Puppet Enterprise license in place at /etc/puppetlabs/license.key on your primary which is not going to expire in the next 90 days"
                ]
            },
            "pe-compiler-70aefa-0.region-a.domain.com": {
                "failed_tests_count": 0,
                "passing_tests_count": 23,
                "failed_tests_details": []
            },
            "pe-compiler-70aefa-1.region-b.domain.com": {
                "failed_tests_count": 0,
                "passing_tests_count": 23,
                "failed_tests_details": []
            }
        },

        ],

            "pe-compiler-70aefa-1.region-b.domain.com",
            "pe-compiler-70aefa-0.region-a.domain.com",
            "pe-psql-70aefa-0.region-a.domain.com"
        ]
    },
    "errors": {},
    "status": "failing",
    "failing_node_count": 1,
    "passing_node_count": 3
}
```

### Using a Puppet Query to report status.

As the pe_status_check module uses Puppet's existing fact behavior to gather the status data from each of the agents, it is possible to use PQL (puppet query language) to gather this information.

Consult with your local Puppet administrator to construct a query suited to your organizational needs. 
Please find some examples of using pe_client_tools to query the status check facts below:

1. To find the complete output of pe_status_check from all nodes listed by certname:

      ```shell
      puppet query 'facts[certname,value] { name = "pe_status_check" }'
      ```
        
2. To find the complete output of agen_status_check from all nodes listed by certname (this could be a large query based on the number of agent nodes, further filtering is advised ):

      ```shell
      puppet query 'facts[certname,value] { name = "agent_status_check" }'
      ```

3. To find those nodes with a  specific status check set to false:

      ```shell
      puppet query 'inventory[certname] { facts.pe_status_check.S0001 = false }'
      ```

#### Setup Requirements

`pe_status_check::infra_summary` and `pe_status_check::agent_summary` utilize [hiera](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/hiera_intro.html) to lookup test definitions, this requires placing a static hierarchy in your **environment level** [hiera.yaml](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/hiera_config_yaml_5.html).

```yaml
plan_hierarchy:
  - name: "Static data"
    path: "static.yaml"
    data_hash: yaml_data
```

See the following [documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/hiera.html#outside-apply-blocks) for further explanation.

#### Running the plans

The `pe_status_check::infra_summary` and `pe_status_check::agent_summary` plans can be run from the [PE console](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/running_plans_from_the_console_.html) or from [the command line](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/running_plans_from_the_command_line.html). Below are some examples of running the plans from the command line. More information on the parameters in the plan can be seen in the [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

Example call from the command line to run `pe_status_check::infra_summary` against all infrastructure nodes:

```shell
puppet plan run pe_status_check::infra_summary
```
Example call from the command line to run `pe_status_check::agent_summary` against all regular agent nodes:

```shell
puppet plan run pe_status_check::agent_summary
```

Example call from the command line to run against a set of infrastructure nodes:

```shell
puppet plan run pe_status_check::infra_summary targets=pe-server-70aefa-0.region-a.domain.com,pe-psql-70aefa-0.region-a.domain.com
```

Example call from the command line to exclude indicators for `pe_status_check::infra_summary`:

```shell
puppet plan run pe_status_check::infra_summary -p '{"indicator_exclusions": ["S0001","S0021"]}'
```
Example call from the command line to exclude indicators for `pe_status_check::agent_summary`:

```shell
puppet plan run pe_status_check::agent_summary -p '{"indicator_exclusions": ["AS001","AS002"]}'
```

## Reference

### Fact: pe_status_check_role

This fact is used to determine which individual status checks should be run on each individual infrastructure node. The fact queries which Puppet Enterprise Roles have been classified to each node and uses this to make the determination.


| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| primary | The node is both a certificate authority and a postgres host |
| replica | The node has the primary_master_replica role |
| pe_compiler | The node has both the master and puppetdb roles |
| postgres | The node has just the database role |
| legacy_compiler | The node has the master role but not the puppetdb role |
| legacy_primary | The node is a certificate authority but not a postgres host |
| unknown | The node type could not be determined |

A failure to determine node type will result in a safe subset of checks being run that will work on all infrastructure node types.


### Fact: pe_status_check

This fact is confined to run on infrastructure nodes only.

Refer  below for next steps when any indicator reports a `false`.

[See the documentation.](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/getting_support_for_pe.html#puppet_metrics_collector)                                                                   | After system metrics are configured, you do not see any files in `/var/log/sa` or if the `/var/log/sa` directory does not exist, open a Support ticket.                                                 |
| S0041        | Determines if the pxp broker on a compiler  has an established connection to another pxp broker  | To resolve a connection issue from a compiler to a pcp broker examine the following log `/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/pcp-broker.log` for an explanation, Compilers should be attempting to make a connection to port 8143 on the primary server, ssl can not be terminated on a network appliance and must passthrough directly to the primary server. Ensure the connnection attempt is not to another compiler in the pool            | If unable to make a connection to a broker, raise a ticket with the support team quoting S0041 and attaching the file `/var/log/puppetlabs/puppetserver/pcp-broker.log` along with the conclusions of your investigation so far            |
| S0042        |Determines if the pxp-agent has an established connection to a pxp broker                   | Ensure the pxp-agent service is running.

| S0043        |Determines if there are nodes with Puppet agent versions ahead of the primary server                    | Agent nodes should not be running Puppet agent versions ahead of infrastructure nodes. Instead consider upgrading PE so that PE package management contains the desired Puppet agent version. See the [upgrading PE](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/upgrading_pe.html) and [upgrading agents](https://puppet.com/docs/latest/upgrading_agents.html) documentation for more information.                 | If you are unable to determine why the indicator is evaluating to `false` or have questions about Puppet agent versions, open a support ticket and reference S0043.            |
| S0044        |Determines if Puppet Servers are using the the PE classifier for the node data plugin (node terminus)                    | Due to performance optimizations, it is recommended to use the PE classifier plugin instead of external node classifier (ENC) scripts or applications. See the [node_terminus configuration setting documentation](https://www.puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/configuration.html#node-terminus) for more information.                 | If you have additional questions about the node_terminus configuration setting, open a support ticket and reference S0044.            |

### Fact: agent_status_check

This fact is confined to run on only agent nodes that are NOT infrastructure nodes.

Refer below for next steps when any indicator reports a `false`.
