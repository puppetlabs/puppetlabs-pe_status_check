## Description

puppetlabs-self_service aims to provide a mechanism to alert the end-user when Puppet Enterprise is not in an ideal state.
It uses pre-set indicators and has a simplified output that directs the end-user to next steps for resolution.

Users of the tool should expect greater ability to provide the self served resolutions, as well as shorter incident resolution times with Puppet Enterprise Support due to higher quality information available to support cases.

## Setup

### What self_service affects

This module installs a structured fact named self_service, which contains an array of key pairs tha simply output an indicator ID and a boolean value.

### Setup Requirements

Plugin-Sync should be enabled to deliver the facts this module requires

### Beginning with self_service

puppetlabs-self_service primarily provides the indicators by means of facts so installing the module and allowing plugin sync to occur will allow the module to start functioning

## Usage

The Facts contained in this module can be used for direct consumption by monitoring tools such as Splunk, any element in the structured fact `self_service` reporting as "false" indicates a fault state in Puppet Enterprise.
When any of the elements reports as false, the incident ID should be looked up in the reference section for next steps

Alternatively, assigning the class self_service to the infrastructure will "Notify" on each Puppet run if any of the indicators are in a fault state.

### Class Declaration *Optional.*

To activate the notification functions of this module, classify your Puppet Infrastructure  with the self_service class using your preferred classification method. Below is an example using site.pp.

```puppet
node 'node.example.com' {
  include self_service
}
```

While the entirety of the default indicators should be reported on for maximum coverage, it may be necessary to make exceptions for your particular environment.
to do this classify the array parameter indicator_exclusions with an list of all indicators you do not want to report on.

```puppet
class { 'self_service':
  indicator_exclusions             => ['S0001','S0003','S0003','S0004'],
}
```

This section should be referred to for next steps when any indicator reports a fault
