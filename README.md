## Description

puppetlabs-pe_status_check provides a way to alert the end-user when Puppet Enterprise is not in an ideal state. It uses pre-set indicators and has a simplified output that directs the end-user to next steps for resolution.

Users of the tool have greater ability to provide their own self-service resolutions and shorter incident resolution times with Puppet Support due to higher quality information available to our team.

## Setup

### What pe_status_check affects

This module installs two structured facts named `pe_status_check` and `agent_status_check`. Each fact contains an array of key pairs that output an indicator ID and a Boolean value. The `pe_status_check` fact is confined to only Puppet Enterprise infrastructure agents, and the `agent_status_check` fact is confined to non-infrastructure agent nodes.

### Setup requirements

Enable plug-in sync to deliver required facts for this module.

### Beginning with pe_status_check

This module primarily provides indicators using facts, so installing the module and allowing plug-in sync to occur lets the module start functioning.

## Usage

The facts in this module can be directly consumed by monitoring tools such as Splunk, any element in the structured facts `pe_status_check` or `agent_status_check` reporting as `false` indicates a fault state in Puppet Enterprise. When any element reports as `false`, look up the incident ID in the reference section for next steps.

Alternatively, assigning the `class pe_status_check` to the infrastructure notifies on each Puppet run if any indicator is reporting as `false`.

### Class declaration (optional)

To activate the notification functions of this module, classify your Puppet Infrastructure  with the `pe_status_check` class using [your preferred classification method](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/grouping_and_classifying_nodes.html#enable_console_configuration_data). Below is an example using `site.pp`.

```puppet
node 'node.example.com' {
  include pe_status_check
}
```

For maximum coverage, report on all default indicators. However, if you need to  make exceptions for your environment, classify the array parameter `indicator_exclusions` with a list of all the indicators you do not want to report on.

This workflow is not available for the `agent_status_check` fact.

```puppet
class { 'pe_status_check':
  indicator_exclusions             => ['S0001','S0003','S0003','S0004'],
}
```

## Reference

Refer to this section for next steps when any indicator reports a `false`.
